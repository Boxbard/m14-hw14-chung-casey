## CSS and Javascript framework

### Columns

I used the clearfix element to create a responsive column for my paragraph and image on the home page. At first I tried the other column elements, but it wasn't as responsive as I wanted. The text wrapping is really nice, and I don't have to worry about the resizing and breakpoints when the layout swaps to be more mobile friendly.

### Navigation

Navigation bar is commented on each page. It features my name, a dropdown, and some other pages (that I now realize I didn't need, I was just doing it for fun.)

### Other Bootstrap components

Created a button on the hero block in the index.html file. Additionally, created a list group using the Flush element to remove the borders on the list that has group items edge-to-edge in a parent container.
